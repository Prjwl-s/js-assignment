    <h1>Datatypes in JS</h1>  
    <h3>1. Strings</h3>
    <p><b>A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "Your Name".<br>Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes.</b></p>
    <h3>2.Numbers</h3>
    <p><b>JavaScript has only one type of numbers.<br>Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:</b></p>
    <h3>3.Booleans </h3>
    <p><b>Booleans can only have two values: true or false.<br>Booleans are often used in conditional testing.</b></p>
    <h3>4.Arrays</h3>
    <p><b>JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.<br>Array items are separated by commas.<br>Array indexes are zero-based, which means the first item is [0], second is [1], and so on.</b></p>
    <h3>5.Objects</h3>
    <p><b>JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.<br>Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.<br>var person = {firstName:"First_Name", LastName:"Last_Name", age:500, eye-color:"Green"};<br>The object (person) in the example above has 4 properties: firstName, LastName, age, and eye-color.</b></p>
    <h3>6.Undefined</h3>
    <p><b>In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.<br>Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined.</b></p>
    <h3>7.Null</h3>
    <p><b>In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.<br>Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.<br>You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.</b></p>
